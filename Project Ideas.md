## Second Capstone Project Ideas


### Idea 1: My Yelper

Review analysis has become a critical reference in recommendation and business strategies nowadays. Exploring usersâ€™ feedbacks provides incredible insights. We plan to use various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Analytics techniques for building a hybrid recommendation engine for restaurants based on Yelp customer reviews.  

Both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering have their strengths and weaknesses. We plan to mix both recommendations methods in addition to Friends reviews to provide a better personalized recommendation system.



### Idea 2: Analysis of NYC Traffic Accidents

According to Forbes, NYC is 41.1% greater-than-average accident frequency in the U.S. Therefore certain solutions need to be designed, from the analysis of associated NYC traffic dataset, in order to reduce the rate of traffic accidents in NYC.  

In order to determine the optimal algorithm, we plan to test the performances of various classification and clustering algorithms. As a result we will be able to determine the contributing factor and vehicle type involved in the traffic accidents with the highest frequency, at given time, location etc., and hence proposes solutions to reduce the rate of traffic accidents.



### Idea 3: Homesite Quote Conversion

[Homesite](https://homesite.com/), a leading provider of homeowners insurance, does not currently have a dynamic conversion rate model that can give them confidence a quoted price will lead to a purchase.  

Using an anonymized database of information on customer and sales activity, including property and coverage information, Homesite is challenging you to predict which customers will purchase a given quote. Accurately predicting conversion would help Homesite better understands the impact of proposed pricing changes and maintains an ideal portfolio of customer segments.
