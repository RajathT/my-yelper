## Project Proposal - Second Capstone Project  

## My Yelper


### Problem:

Recommendation systems have become an integral part of many businesses. They produce individualized recommendations as output or have the effect of guiding the user in a personalized way to interesting objects in a larger space of possible options.  

In this project, we want to apply machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models and hence build a hybrid restaurant recommendation system that suggests the most suitable restaurant for users based on user’s preset criteria. We also plan to add consumer’s friends’ recommendations to the equation for additional personalization.  




### Client:

Modern consumers greatly benefit from restaurant recommendation systems. It is so useful to get a list of restaurants that match consumer’s preferences without much hustles, comparing, and browsing through a long list of reviews for each single restaurant.  

Yelp is one of those websites that publish crowd source reviews to help users and business owners. Yelp users are assumed to be the client who benefit from this project.



### Data:

The [Yelp Challenge Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) is a subset of Yelp’s businesses, reviews, and user data for use in personal, educational, and academic purposes. The dataset consists of 5.79 gigabytes JSON files that contains data about businesses, reviews, Users, check-in hours, tips, and photos. The dataset version for this project contains 4.7M reviews on 156K businesses in 12 metropolitan areas.


### Approach:

Yelp users give ratings and write reviews about businesses and services on Yelp. These reviews and ratings help other Yelp users to evaluate a business or a service and make a choice. While ratings are useful to convey the overall experience, they do not convey the context which led a reviewer to that experience.  

We plan to use various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Analytics techniques for building a hybrid recommendation engine for restaurants based on Yelp customer reviews.  

Both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering have their strengths and weaknesses. We plan to mix both recommendations methods in addition to Friends reviews to provide a better personalized recommendation system.



### Deliverables:
